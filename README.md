This repository is for projects in development by ALR and CHM et. al. ;-)
<ol>
<li>Develop meaningful, intuitive tag ontology for easy on the go use. Like throwing a handful of breadcrumbs. Should be that easy to use</li>
<li>Develop scripts / other frameworks to input tagged work and parse out into meaningful data sections.</li>
<li>Develop ways to display that data meaningfully.</li>
<li>Develop ways to track and visualize the data patterns over time, location, and other parameters as desired.</li>
<li>Predict system changes and pivot points where deploying specific resources / effects will create environment where desired outcome has great possibility of success.</li>
</ol>
